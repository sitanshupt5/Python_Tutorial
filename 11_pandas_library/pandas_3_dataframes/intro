A DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled data structure in Pandas, essentially a table with
rows and columns. It is similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table. Columns in a DataFrame can be
of different data types, like integers, floats, strings, or even Python objects.
For this section we will be importing python data structures from pandas_1_intro directory
which we will be creating dataframes to operate on.
We are dividing dataframes over different modules like creation, access, modification,
operations etc.
Please go through the individual modules.
