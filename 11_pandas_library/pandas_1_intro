Pandas is a powerful open-source data analysis and manipulation library for Python. It
provides easy to use easy to use data structures and functions designed to make working with
structured data fast, easy and expressive. The 2 main data structures in pandas are Series
and DataFrame.
Series is a  one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any datatypes(integers,
strings, floats and other python objects). Series can be created from a list, tuple,
array or dictionary.
A Dataframe is a two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different
types. It is similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table. Dataframes can be created from various
sources like lists, dictionaries, series arrays or even external sources like csv files,
Excel files or databases.

Applications and Uses of Pandas:
--------------------------------
•	Pandas provides powerful tools for cleaning and preparing data. This includes handling
	missing data, data normalization, data transformation, and more.
•	Pandas facilitates data exploration and analysis by providing methods for grouping,
	aggregation, filtering, and sorting data.
•	Although pandas itself does not provide visualization capabilities, it integrates well
	with libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
•	Pandas offers robust support for working with time series data, including date range
	generation, resampling, time zone handling, and more.
•	Pandas can read data from various file formats like CSV, Excel, JSON, SQL databases, and
	HDF5, and can also write data to these formats.

These are just a few examples of the many applications and uses of pandas in Python. Its
flexibility and versatility make it an essential tool for data analysis and manipulation in
various domains.
