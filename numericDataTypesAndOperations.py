"""
Python has several classes of built in datatypes. Some of them are:
numeric, iterator, sequence (which are also iterators), mapping, file, class, exception.
Python3 has 3 numeric dataTypes: int, float and complex.
int and float deal with integers and decimals where as complex deals with complex/imaginary
numbers.
Following are the operators used to carry out operations on numeric data.
"""
a = 5
b = 6
print(a + b)
print(a - b)
print(a * b)
print(a / b)      # Returns result with decimal extension, i.e. float type data
print(a // b)     # Returns result as an integer without decimal extension
print(a % b)

# In case of multiple operators occuring in an expression then operator precedence comes
# into the picture. Follow the BODMAS rule or BEDMAS rule as taught in school.
